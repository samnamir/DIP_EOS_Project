# DIP_EOS_Project
I developed this ML project along with my colleague Omama Zahidi as an end of semester project of digital image processing course. This solution provides segmentation of non-melanoma skin cells images into 12 different pixel classes and then further classifies the masks of these images into one of 3 most common forms of non-melanoma skin cancer.
